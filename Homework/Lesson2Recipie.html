                <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                    <ul> 
                
                        <li>225 g self-raising flour</li>
                        <li>Sugar</li> 
                        <li> 2 tsp baking powder</li>
                        <li> 4 medium eggs</li>
                        <li> 225 g soft margarine or butter</li>
                        <li> 225 g caster sugar</li>
                        <li> Zest of 2 lemons</li>
                        <li> 2 tsp milk</li>
                
                    </ul>

                <h2>Instructions</h2>

                    <ol> 

                        <li> Preheat your oven to 160C/140C fan. Line your baking tins (I use 2 x 20cm round sandwich tins) with baking parchment or reusable baking liners.</li>
                        <li>Finely grate the zest of two lemons.</li>
                        <li>Sift the self-raising flour (225g) and baking powder (2 tsp) into a large bowl.</li>
                        <li>Add the remaining ingredients (4 medium eggs, 225g soft margarine or butter, 225g caster sugar, grated lemon zest and 2 tsp milk) and beat (with an electric mixer on a slow speed or by hand) until combined. Make sure that there are no small lumps of butter/margarine in your mixture. If there are, beat for a little longer until the mixture is smooth.</li>
                        <li>Split the mixture equally between the pre-prepared tins. Use the back of a spoon to spread the mixture evenly in the tins.</li>
                        <li>Bake for 30-35 minutes. To check if the cake is cooked insert a skewer into the centre and if it comes out clean the cake is ready.</li>
                        <li>Leave the cake to cool in the tins for about 10 minutes. Remove them from the tins and then move them to a wire rack to cool completely. Make sure the cake has cooled completely before decorating.</li>
